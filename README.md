## Illustrations and User Flow

Here is a quick and simplified user flow of the app:

Begin by creating an account or logging in from the homepage. Once logged in, the user will end up on the decks homepage where they can access their previously created decks.

<br><br>
They can start by creating a "memory deck" and adding flashcards manually or using the AI-assisted option for automated and quick deck creation.

## Roadmap

Here are some possible features new contributors could add (includes the optional user story we did not implement):
- **Search and Filter Decks**: Implement a search bar or filter tags to allow users to easily find specific decks.
- **Flashcard Enhancements**: Support rich content in flashcards, such as audio clips or formatted text.
- **Scheduled Test Reminders**: Implement a scheduling and automated email reminder system that will notify a user to take their daily test at a previously scheduled reminder time.
